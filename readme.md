# Functional Threaded JSON lexer in C

Inspired by rob pikes design I decided to make an overly complicated lexer,
note that this is a toy project so it may jave bugs, but I think it's a neat
example an alternative method of building a lexer in C.

## Build

use the included shell script ```./mk.sh```

## Run

invoke as ```./a.out sample.json```
