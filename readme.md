# Functional threaded JSON lexer in C

Inspired by rob pikes design. Note that this is a toy project so it may jave
bugs, but I think it's an interesting example of an alternative method for
building a lexer.

## Build

use the included shell script ```./mk.sh```

## Run

invoke as ```./a.out sample.json```
